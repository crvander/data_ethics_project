## The Goal

The American criminal justice system is a web of tangled, complicated, and non-isolated problems that burden taxpayers to a government institution, creating a compelling need for policy reform. Even though US incarceration has the lowest rate since 1995, it still has the largest incarcerated population in the world[^1], with an unbalanced tendency towards Black and Latino communities.

The goal of this analysis is not to show how to fix this puzzle due to its complexity but to shed the light on how and where to address to improve our justice system. Like many other puzzles, it is possible to start anywhere â€“pick a piece randomly, but it can take longer, and we might lose track and motivation to solve it. By Starting with racial and social inequalities, we can tackle the overcrowding in prisons that leads to mass incarceration and private prisons concerns.
